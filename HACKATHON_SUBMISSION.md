# ReLearn AI - Hackathon Submission Materials

## 1. Project Description (<250 Words)
ReLearn AI is an intelligent, multimodal learning companion designed to transform static study materials into dynamic, personalized educational experiences. Powered by **Gemini 3 Pro**, ReLearn goes beyond simple summarization by constructing deep knowledge graphs, generating visual analogies, and creating animated video explainers on the fly. 

The platform features an adaptive **Study Roadmap** that evolves with the learner, using advanced NLP to detect concept clusters and potential learning gaps. Its "Deep Dive" mode leverages Gemini's reasoning capabilities to connect uploaded notes with real-time web research, offering students a holistic understanding of complex topics. With integrated Socratic quizzing, voice interaction, and a "Wow" factor 3D Knowledge Map, ReLearn reimagines the future of self-paced learning, making elite-level tutoring accessible to anyone, anywhere.

## 2. Video Demo Script (2 Minutes)
**[0:00-0:15] Hook:** "Studying is broken. We drown in PDFs and disjointed notes. Meet ReLearn." (Visual: Uploading a dense 50-page PDF).
**[0:15-0:45] Core Transformation:** "Watch as Gemini 3 Pro instantly dissects this complex physics paper. It doesn't just summarize; it builds a 3D Knowledge Graph (Visual: Concept Map spinning), identifies key clusters, and generates a 'Hard' level Socratic quiz to test true understanding."
**[0:45-1:10] The "Wow" Factor:** "Stuck on a concept? Click 'Animate'. ReLearn uses Gemini Veo to generate a custom 20-second animated explainer video specifically for *this* paragraph." (Visual: Video Panel generating and playing a clip).
**[1:10-1:40] Reasoning & Roadmap:** "It’s not just a viewer; it’s a coach. The Roadmap feature analyzes content density to build a 4-week schedule with gamified XP. It even warns you about 'Risk Concepts'—areas where students typically fail."
**[1:40-2:00] Closing:** "Accessible, multimodal, and deeply intelligent. ReLearn turns information into knowledge. Built with Gemini."

3.  **"Study Smarter, Not Harder: 3D Knowledge Maps"**

## 4. Impact Section
*   **Education:** Democratizes access to high-quality, personalized tutoring. The "Deep Dive" feature bridges the gap between static textbooks and the dynamic web, fostering critical thinking rather than rote memorization.
*   **Accessibility:** Full voice interaction ("Teach me this") and dyslexia-friendly modes ensure that diverse learners can engage with complex material. The transition from text to video/animation aids visual learners significantly.
*   **Reasoning:** Unlike standard RAG apps, ReLearn uses Gemini's chain-of-thought to identify *misconceptions* before they form, acting as a proactive pedagogical agent.
*   **Multimodality:** Seamlessly blending Text-to-Text, Text-to-Image (Visualizer), and Text-to-Video (Veo integration) creates a rich, immersive learning environment that mimics a real-world classroom.

## 5. Judges Pitch Summary
ReLearn is a **Concept-to-Curriculum Engine**. It solves the "Analysis Paralysis" students face with large documents.
**Why it wins:**
1.  **Deep Integration:** Uses Gemini for *everything*—reasoning, image generation, video creation, and TTS.
2.  **Visual Innovation:** The 3D Knowledge Graph and "AI Animated Lesson" features provide immediate visual gratification and utility.
3.  **Technical Complexity:** Implements advanced NLP clustering, force-directed graph visualization, and real-time API streaming in a polished React frontend.
4.  **Polish:** It looks and feels like a shipped product, not just a hackathon script.
